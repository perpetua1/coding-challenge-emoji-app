# Part 1 - Emoji Search

Requirements:

  - The system will present a list of all emojis when no search term is present.
  - The system will filter the list of emojis by name based on the text in the search bar.

Requirements:

  - The system will automatically translate emoji's `shortcodes` to their respective symbols as the user types.
